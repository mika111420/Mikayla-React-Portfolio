# Mikayla React Portfolio

## Description
This React portfolio is an elite showcase of my skills, projects, and personal information. It serves as an online resume and portfolio to highlight my qualifications and accomplishments as a web developer! It features a homepage that introduces me and my role as a developer, an 'About Me' section with a profile image and expands further on my goals as a junior developer. A portfolio; a section showcasing my projects complete with links to live demos or source code. A contact form and email link for easy communication & my downloadable resume for a detailed overview of my qualifications.
